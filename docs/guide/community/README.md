## Questions and Support

### Stack Overflow

If you have a question about how to use Vue Formulate please ask it on
Stack Overflow tagged with `vue-formulate`. When you do, please include code
examples and if possible, a link to a CodePen or CodeSandbox so the community
can further assist you (see [Code Playgrounds](#code-playgrounds) below)

<stack-overflow-link />

### Vue Discord (Generalized help)

Stack Overflow is not the right place to ask generalized "Why doesn't my code
work" questions. It's intended to ask questions about isolated issues. If you're
in need of more generalized help, consider asking it on the #code-help channel
on the Vue discord server. If you are not already a member (it's free and open)
you'll first need to use the invite link to join the server.

### GitHub Issues (Bugs and Features)

GitHub issues are reserved for feature requests and bug reports, but if you've
found a bug, please report it! Feature requests are always going to be a bit
subjective, but if you believe there's a large use case that is currently under
served by Vue Formulate, we want to know that too.

## Code playgrounds

We maintain a Vue Formulate enabled CodePen and CodeSandbox to let you quickly
mockup your forms and reproduce issues or bugs you might have. If you want to
just play around, or plan to file an issue, coding up an example is a great
place to start.

### CodePen
When able, we recommend using CodePen, but it is limited to one
Single File Component. To create your own fork, click "Use this template" in the
bottom right of the page.

<codepen-link />

### CodeSandbox

CodeSandbox is a little more full-featured, allowing multiple Single File
Components like you might use in your own project. Also if you're wanting to use
initialization `Vue.use(VueFormulate, {...})`, features this is the one to use.
